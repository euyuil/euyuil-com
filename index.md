Hi, I'm Liu Yue (刘跃), a full-stack developer with 10 years of experience building cloud services and web apps. I've also developed trading and research systems for algo and high-frequency trading. I'm passionate about crafting clean, efficient code and delivering innovative solutions to complex challenges.

## My journey

I started programming at the age of 11, teaching myself Visual Basic. As Dÿkstra once remarked, "It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration."[^1] Despite this, I went on to win first prize[^3] in NOIP[^2] using C++ during high school.

In university, I continued to build on my passion for coding, winning a bronze medal[^4] in the ACM-ICPC regional during my second year while majoring in software engineering at Tongji University[^9]. I also led the Google Camp[^7] as president in my third year and received both the National Scholarship[^10] and Google Scholarship[^8].

My professional career began at Microsoft, where I worked on scaling Azure storage[^5] clusters to meet the rapid growth of cloud computing. After gaining experience at hedge funds for two years, I returned to Microsoft, where I now work on the Azure CDN[^6] team, orchestrating control plane workflows on distributed systems.

## My philosophy

I believe it's crucial not just to create and solve problems, but to deeply understand user needs and market demands. It's not enough to build something cool and hope people will love it - we need to be driven by real needs to ensure the business thrives and generates value.

As for learning, I think curiosity is key. It's important not to limit ourselves to what seems immediately useful. By exploring a wide range of topics, we build a rich, interconnected knowledge base that equips us to tackle challenges we've never encountered before.

## Outside of work

When I'm not coding, I'm always eager to learn something new, whether it's the latest tech trends like machine learning or diving into areas like probability theory, game theory, economics, finance and so on. I enjoy broadening my knowledge across various fields to keep my mind sharp and adaptable.

I also like to relax by playing video games, particularly FPS titles. I'm a Steam user and occasionally game on my Nintendo Switch and Xbox.

## Let's connect

If you'd like to connect or learn more about my work, feel free to reach out to me at [contact@euyuil.com](mailto:contact@euyuil.com).

I'm currently based in Shanghai, and I'm open to meeting offline for coffee or a chat about potential collaborations. I enjoy meeting new people from all industries, not just tech.

Thanks for stopping by!
